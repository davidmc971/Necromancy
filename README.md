This is the GitHub for my forked version of Necromancy.
===
Aimed to work with new versions of Minecraft and I might add newer content depending on how it all goes.

Right now I have a lot of stuff to work though before I even get rid of all the errors. Nontheless, I have got a working environment for vscode and the project structure for 1.16.x Forge.

### The original version can be found at:
* https://github.com/sirolf2009/Necromancy
* https://github.com/sirolf2009/NecroAPI

I have put the NecroAPI inside this project for now.

### The Version forked from the original by _AtomicStryker_ to work with MC 1.7.x can be found here:
* http://www.atomicstryker.net/necromancy.php
* https://github.com/AtomicStryker/atomicstrykers-minecraft-mods/commits/1.7.10/Necromancy

_The Necromancy mod is all about necromancy. Also known as the art of reanimation. using this mod, you can reanimate slain foes and use your minions to rule the world (of minecraftia)!_
